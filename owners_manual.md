DrivingDeflation Warning System
Instead of directly measuring the pressure in each tyre, the defl ation warning system 
on this vehicle monitors and compares the rolling radius and rotational 
characteristics of each wheel and tyre while you are driving to determine if one or 
more tyres are signific antly under-inflated. 
This will cause the low tyre pressure/deflation 
warning system indicator to come on and a 
message to appear on the gauge.
You must start deflation warning sy stem calibration every time you:
•Adjust the pressure in one or more tyres.
•Rotate the tyres.
•Replace one or more tyres.
Before calibrating the deflation warning system:•Set the cold tyre pressu re in all four tyres.
2Checking Tyres  P. 711
Make sure:
•The vehicle is at a complete stop.
•The transmission is in (P.
•The power mode is in ON.1Deflation Warning System
The system does not monito r the tyres when driving 
①t low speed.
Conditions such as low ambient temperature and 
①ltitude change directly a ffect tyre pressure and can 
trigger the low tyre pressure/deflation warning 
system indicator to come on.
Tyre pressure checked and inflated in:
•Warm weather can beco me under-inflated in 
colder weather.
•Cold weather can become overinflated in warmer 
weather.
The low tyre pressure/d eflation warning system 
indicator will not come on as  a result of overinflation.
The deflation warning sy stem may not function 
properly if tyre type  and size are mixed. 
Make sure to use the same size and type of tyre.

The Vehicle Stability Assist (VSA) system, brake 
system (Amber), Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) with 
Low Speed Follow, low ty re pressure/deflation 
warning system, Collision Mi tigation Braking System 
(CMBS), Road Departure Mitigation and safety 
support indicators may come on in amber along with 
① message in the gauge when you set the power mode to ON after reconne cting the 12-v olt battery.
Drive a short distance at mo re than 20 km/h (12 mph).
Each indicator should go off. If any do not, have your vehicle checked by a dealer.
